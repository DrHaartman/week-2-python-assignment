Python List Operations README
This script demonstrates several fundamental operations on a Python list. It begins by initializing an empty list and appending four integer values.

The code then showcases:

Insertion: Placing a new element at a specific index.

Extension: Appending multiple elements from another list.

Removal: Deleting the last element using pop().

Sorting: Arranging the list elements in ascending order.

Searching: Finding and printing the index of a specific value.

The final, modified list is then printed to the console. This script serves as a simple, clear example of common list manipulations in Python.
